# CRUD API with TypeScript - Backend


## What you built? 

This mini project follows a tutorial on how to build a CRUD API using Typescript, Node and Express. Both of us do not have any experience in Web Development and we thought that this project would be a good introduction to it. The CRUD Api allows users to create, update and delete data about menu items in a restaurant using. The data is stored in a local, in-memory MongoDB database. Express handles the routes that perform the CRUD operations.

Include some screenshots.

## Who Did What?

Isuru - Worked on initializing the project, setting up the environmental variables. Set up the Typescript interfaces and created a Node.js service and Express Controllers.

Kevin - Set up the Express app and configuration, importing project dependencies and was responsible for testing the Express API Endpoints, Implementing Express Error Handlon and tested the API with a demo client.

## What you learned

Typescript fundamentals: static typing, creating interfaces.
Node.js: handling backend server operations, from the basics such as connecting to a local client. Listening to client responses and handling them.
Express.js: Handling routing in a web app.
