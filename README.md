# CRUD API with TypeScript - Backend


## What you built? 

This mini project follows a tutorial on how to build a CRUD API using Typescript, Node and Express. Kevin and I do not have any experience in Web Development and we thought that this project would be a good introduction to it. The CRUD Api allows users to create, update and delete data about menu items in a restaurant using. The data is stored in a local, in-memory MongoDB database. Express handles the routes that perform the CRUD operations.

Include some screenshots.
